<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m washing up, I can listen to sermons.&rdquo;, &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m in a queue and there is no-one to talk to, I can level up on a gamified Bible memory app.&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>I first found this to be a good principle. On my route to university, I would use this little Sansa Clip thing and made it through some great works like Eusebius, Owen etc. I found in those days that the labour involved in TTSing a notepad file and transfering via USB to this dumb audio player precluded stray in intention. Eg there was no podcast app advertizing the lastest episodes to distract me.</p>
<p>What changed over the years was the migration of my time-redeeming listening from the Clip to a smartphone. This made it much easier for distractions to crowd in, and, essentially, lower-quality higher-sugar content to displace the higher-quality.</p>
<p>A second issue, and the more important one in my view, is twofold, specifically that instantiating redeeming the time as listening to good content when your ears are otherwise disengaged can easily drift in two ways. Firstly, in that the dopamine received when hearing new content can very easily become an addiction which was just now called a good.</p>
<p>Secondly, that the ear-disengaging acts (washing the dishes, walking the dog) can become sought after and elongated in order to maximize the dopamine enjoyment &ndash; a kind of Goodhart&rsquo;s law. If washing the dishes becomes an enjoyable task <em>because you can redeem the time doing it</em>, you will naturally, without self-restraint, seek to dwell on the washing to make sure you complete your episode of History of England or whatever. The redemption has become consumption.</p>
<p>We were not created to be bombarded with information all the time, especially not in the easily-digestible form of audiobooks or podcasts. And if the audiobooks are genuinely high quality, it is likely we will need time to reflect on what we have heard, to digest it, in order to avoid being sugar junkies without depth. This would require that redeeming the time become to be in your own thoughts without external stimulation, contradicting the normal way the principle is talked about.</p>
<p>Further, there is good in simply being in the world, being available to notice Creation as it is, rather than steaming past it in somebody else&rsquo;s world he creates with his words.</p>
<p>One final thought, I always wondered whether listening to a man of God bring God&rsquo;s Word while performing menial tasks is a sufficiently reverent mode of reception. My answer in former days was to listen to a sermon at 1x only, whereas everything else receives as least 1.5x. Now I think God&rsquo;s Word needs our full attention, and the menial task becomes faffing in relation to what we are hearing.</p>
<p>I took slight objection to their framing that if you aren&rsquo;t mature enough &lsquo;yet&rsquo;, then a smartphone is not for you. Within their framing there is a hierarchy lacking justification that the mature will have and use these devices well, however there is nothing inherent in maturity requiring using such devices.</p>
