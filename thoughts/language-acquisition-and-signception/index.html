<p>Learning a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; language really oughn&rsquo;t be so hard, but sadly, due to the methods of instruction which have predominated at least since the Victorians, it is rendered almost an impossibility for most people. In fact, proper acquisition of the language <em>per se</em> is not necessarily even seen as a goal by most instructors who are instead satisfied with their students&rsquo; ability to &lsquo;decode&rsquo; the language into their own, thereby facilitating native comprehension, though only after a pointless expenditure of energy not-reading the original.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/what-does-the-latin-actually-say/">Mary Beard</a>, the famed classicist and author, <a href="http://blogicarian.blogspot.com/2019/03/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam.html">admits she cannot really read Latin</a>.</p>
<p>In <em>De Doctrina Christiana</em>, St. Augustine discusses a great deal about words and signs, which made me realize on reason as to why the current methods are silly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lay down this direction, not to attend to what [signs] are in themselves, but to the fact that they are signs, that is, to what they signify. For a sign is a thing which, over and above the impression it makes on the senses, <strong>causes something else to come into the mind as a consequence of itself</strong>: as when we see a footprint, we conclude that an animal whose footprint this is has passed by; &hellip; [BIICI]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note his point regarding signs, <em>they point to something beyond themselves</em>. A little later, he elides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signs that address themselves to the ear are, as I have said, more numerous, and for the most part consist of words. For though the bugle and the flute and the lyre frequently give not only a sweet but a significant sound, yet all these signs are very few in number compared with words. For among men words have obtained far and away the chief place as a means of indicating the thoughts of the mind. [BIICIII]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, words are &lsquo;signs&rsquo; to the ear (and, we might add, to the mind). When an intelligible word hits you, including involuntarily by glancing at a shop sign or overhearing the radio, the meaning beyond the word is close in attendance. We shall see that with the current method of language instruction, it is not the meaning beyond the sign which comes to the mind, but rather the native-language sign which appears, which only then may be decomposed to the thing signified.</p>
<p>When it comes to ancient language instruction, the theory of words as signs is shelved, and in its place is taught a quasi-mathematical means of converting the foreign into the familiar. Some call this the grammar-translation method, and if you have been instructed in Latin or Hebrew, the chances are this is what you know.</p>
<p>Without digressing to the broader idea of comprehensible input and extensive reading in language acquisition, here is a just a thought piecing the above information together.</p>
<p>If you know Hebrew, you will no doubt recognize the below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית  בָּרָ֣א  אֱלֹהִ֑ים  אֵ֥ת  הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם  וְאֵ֥ת  הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are, like I am, a child of grammar-translation, could you read it? Maybe, but typically the process is two-stage. It becomes, quite literally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning create [perfect 3ms] God [subject] [d.o.m.] the heaven [always plural] and [d.o.m.] the earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is then shuffled around a bit and understood in its English equivalent. Which means the Hebrew sentence, from this perspective, was composed not of signs pointing to realities beyond themselves, but of signs <em>pointing to English signs</em>. A strange form of silliness.</p>
<p>This is what we get as a result of learning long lists of vocabulary and how to parse verbs and reverse engineer morphology, but not how to read. You bounce from the target language to its memorized word-pairs in your language, give them a jiggle, and only then from your language to the thing signified. This may include the use of a standard <del>magic book</del> syntax reference, because you haven&rsquo;t internalized any of this.</p>
<p>Why not just jump to the thing signified straight away? It is what all modern foreign language students do, and if you actually want to read ancient languagues, or bring them into today as many Latin speakers have done, you need to treat ancient languages <em>as languages</em>, not simply as a weird way of obscuring meaning by passing it through a matrix of morphology, syntax, and word-swapping.</p>
<p>I would be pretty offended if something I had written were decomposed in a manner akin to what I have been instructed to do in Greek and Hebrew. It is not reading, it is not understanding, and, one might say, it is not respecful to the author.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even work except for the top 5% who would succeed using any method. Incidentally, it is these who go on to become the next generation of teachers, thinking the method is excellent because it &lsquo;<a href="https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/the-wrong-way-to-teach-latin/">works beautifully</a>&rsquo;. No wonder most students find ancient languages so hard, and almost to a man give up on them. If they don&rsquo;t, they are so reliant on tools to &lsquo;analyze&rsquo; the text, they barely do better than if they were to have read a proper translation. At which point, why bother?</p>
<h2 id="do-this-instead">Do this instead</h2>
<p>These are applicable to all languages.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Seek as much as you can to read texts in the target language which you can understand without recourse to external materials.</li>
<li>That includes dictionaries. Pick a monolignual dictionary if at all possible.</li>
<li><a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/the-new-old-way-of-learning-languages/">Read bilingual resources</a> (including Loebs) every now and then to pick up more advanced syntax, and for more interesting titbits.</li>
<li>As you read, picture the substance of what you are reading in your head, do not picture your native language word equivalents.</li>
<li>If you are really struggling, for Hebrew and Greek you consider using modern resources. Just be aware of the differences (modern Hebrew was made SVO to fit in with other languages, for instance).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you are reading, read aloud also. Listen to audio recordings if available.</li>
<li>Memorize and recite texts you know natively in the target language. This will give you hooks for difficult constructions.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother with long lists of vocabulary. It is largely wasted time as the snow does not settle. It also teaches you to link signs to signs, which is made worse by the inability of this method to teach nuance in word use, since words almost never overlap 1:1 between langauges.</li>
<li>When more advanced, surround yourself with as much random interesting content as you can, both in written and aural form.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using">Using</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gather fellow learners and actually speak with them in the language.</li>
<li>Think in the language whenever you can. Pray in the language. Write your shopping list in the language. <em>Use</em> the language.</li>
<li>Compose reflections in the language on what you have read, or produce summaries of stories in 2-3 sentences.</li>
<li>As you become more comfortable, write, journal, blog in the language.</li>
</ol>
