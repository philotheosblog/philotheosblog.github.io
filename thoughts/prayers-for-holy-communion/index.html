<p><em>A prayer to be used every day in the week before you receive the Holy Communion</em></p>
<p>O BLESSED Lord Jesus Christ, Who dost bid even me, unworthy, to come unto Thee in the Blessed Sacrament of Thy Body and Blood, prepare my soul and my body, I pray Thee, to receive Thee. Give me true sorrow for my past sins, faith in Thee Who didst die upon the Cross to save me, firm purpose to keep from all that displeases Thee, and charity to forgive all who may have vexed me. Lord, come to me that Thou mayest cleanse me. Lord, come to me that Thou mayest heal me. Lord, come to me that Thou mayest strengthen me. And grant that, having received Thee, I may not forget Thee, or drive Thee from me, by being careless about pleasing Thee, but may continue Thine for ever. Amen.</p>
<p><em>On Friday, or some other day before your Communion, ask yourself very carefully the following questions, first saying :</em></p>
<p>PREVENT me, O Lord, in this and all my doings, with Thy most gracious favour, and further me with Thy continual help that in all my works begun, continued, and ended in Thee, I may glorify Thy holy Name, and finally by Thy mercy obtain everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>O GOD of truth, make me, I pray Thee, to know myself. Pour Thy light into the dark places of my heart, that I may see my grievous sins, and tell them truly unto Thee. May I mourn for them as I ought; with a broken and a contrite heart may I confess them; and, returning to my obedience, may I be by Thee forgiven; for Jesus Christ my Saviour&rsquo;s sake. Amen.</p>
<p><em>Since my last Communion :</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Have I fallen into any special sin, which is troubling my mind and keeping me back from God?</li>
<li>Have I honestly tried to love and serve God?</li>
<li>Have I said my prayers reverently and carefully every night and morning?</li>
<li>Have I sworn or used bad words?</li>
<li>Have I laughed and joked, or listened to others doing so, about religion and holy things?</li>
<li>Have I been to church every Sunday and kept the rest of the day as I ought?</li>
<li>When I have been to church have I been attentive and revent, kneeling down, etc.?</li>
<li>Have I been honest and diligent in my work, or have I been slothful and idle, not rising in good time in the morning, or wasting my master&rsquo;s or employer&rsquo;s time?</li>
<li>Have I been obdient at home and to those set over me?</li>
<li>Have I been patient under reproof, not answering again etc.?</li>
<li>Have I quarrelled with any one or lost my temper? thought or spoken evil of another, been unkind or sulky?</li>
<li>If I have quarrelled with any one, have I tried to make it up?</li>
<li>Have I been envious of others? or proud or conceited about myself?</li>
<li>Have I done anything impure, or said anything impure, or encouraged any impure thought?</li>
<li>Have I taken more than I ought to eat or to drink?</li>
<li>Have I been dishonest, or stolen anything?</li>
<li>Have I told a lie? or deceived any one in word or act?</li>
<li>Have I grumbled at my lot, or been discontented or covetous?</li>
<li>Have I in any way helped or encouraged others in what is wrong?</li>
<li>Have I been regular in my times of receiving the Holy Communion?</li>
<li>Was I careful about my preparation and thanksgiving at my last communion, and have I tried to keep the resolutions I then made?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Then confess you sins to God very humbly, saying :</em></p>
<p>I CONFESS to Thee, O God, that I have sinned against Thee in thought, and word, and deed, through my fault, through my own great fault, especially by . . . (<em>here name the sins you have found out by self-examination</em>). O Lord, give me true sorrow; forgive me these and all my many sins which I have forgotten. O let me not fall from Thee any more. I grieve for ever having offended Thee; by Thy help I will serve Thee better for the time to come; I give myself to Thee; henceforth I resolve to serve none but The; I will walk in the way of Thy commandments. Pardon all my failings, O my God, and perfect that good work which Thou hast begun in me. O grant me Thy grace, hear me, help me, and have mercy upon me. And this I ask for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake, my Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>
